To run the website locally, do the following:

To test without security issues, you'll need to run the site through a local web server. 
Navigate to ./earthworks-website
You should see index.html
Then:

1. Using Python (if installed):
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

2. Using Node.js:
```bash
npx http-server
```

Then access your site in your browser enter `http://localhost:8000` instead of opening the files directly.

Choose whichever matches the tools you already have installed.
